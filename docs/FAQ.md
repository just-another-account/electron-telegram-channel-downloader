### What is Telegram Channel Downloader?

2. **Windows**: Run the `.exe` installer
3. **macOS**: Open the `.dmg` file and drag to Applications
4. **Linux**: Use the `.AppImage` file or install the `.deb`/`.rpm` package

### Do I need to install anything else?

No additional software is required. The application is self-contained and includes all necessary dependencies.

### Can I install it on multiple computers?

Yes, you can install and use the application on multiple computers. However, you'll need to authenticate with Telegram on each device separately.

### How do I update the application?

Currently, updates are manual:
1. Download the latest version from GitHub Releases
2. Install over the existing version
3. Your settings and download history will be preserved

*Automatic updates are planned for future versions.*

## üîê Authentication

### Where do I get Telegram API credentials?

1. Visit [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) (official Telegram website)
2. Log in with your phone number
3. Go to "API development tools"
4. Create a new application
5. Copy the API ID and API Hash

### Is it safe to enter my API credentials?

Yes, when obtained from the official Telegram website. The application:
- Stores credentials securely using OS-level encryption
- Never sends credentials to third-party servers
- Only communicates with official Telegram servers
- Is open-source, so you can verify the code

### Can I use the same API credentials on multiple devices?

Yes, the same API credentials can be used on multiple devices. Each device will have its own session, but they share the same API application.

### What if I forgot my 2FA password?

You'll need to recover it through Telegram's official process:
1. In the Telegram app, go to Settings > Privacy and Security > Two-Step Verification
2. Use the "Forgot Password?" option
3. Follow the recovery process via email or security questions

### Why do I need to verify my phone number again?

Telegram requires phone verification for each new session as a security measure. This is standard Telegram API behavior and not specific to this application.

## üì• Download Issues

### Why are some files not downloading?

Several reasons can cause this:
- **File type not selected**: Ensure you've selected the correct content types
- **Permissions**: You might not have access to certain files
- **File size limits**: Some files might exceed Telegram's download limits
- **Network issues**: Check your internet connection
- **Storage space**: Ensure sufficient disk space

### Can I resume interrupted downloads?

Yes, the application automatically detects previously downloaded files and skips them. If a download is interrupted, simply start a new download session and it will continue from where it left off.

### How fast are downloads?

Download speed depends on:
- **Your internet connection** speed
- **Telegram server** performance and location
- **File sizes** being downloaded
- **API rate limits** imposed by Telegram

Typical speeds range from 1-10 MB/s depending on these factors.

### Why do downloads sometimes fail?

Common causes:
- **Network interruptions**: Temporary connectivity issues
- **Telegram rate limits**: Too many API calls in a short time
- **File availability**: The file may have been deleted from Telegram
- **Large file sizes**: Very large files may timeout

The application automatically retries failed downloads and logs errors for review.

### Can I download from private channels?

You can only download from channels, groups, or chats that you have access to. The application cannot bypass Telegram's privacy restrictions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features & Functionality
