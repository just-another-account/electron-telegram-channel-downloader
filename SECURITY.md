## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Secure Storage**: Don't share API credentials or session tokens
3. **Download Sources**: Only download from official sources
4. **System Security**: Keep your operating system updated
5. **Network Security**: Use secure networks for sensitive operations

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**: All code changes require review
2. **Dependency Management**: Regular dependency updates and security scans
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
4. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in errors
5. **Secure Defaults**: Use secure configurations by default

## üîç Security Features

### Application Security

- **Encrypted Storage**: API credentials and session tokens are encrypted
- **Local Processing**: No data sent to external servers (except Telegram API)
- **Secure Communication**: All API calls use HTTPS/WSS
- **Input Sanitization**: User inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Minimal Permissions**: Requests only necessary permissions

### Build Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security scans of dependencies
- **Code Analysis**: Static code analysis for security issues
- **Signed Releases**: Distribution packages are digitally signed
- **Reproducible Builds**: Build process is documented and reproducible

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### Inherent Risks

1. **API Credentials**: Users must protect their Telegram API credentials
2. **Session Tokens**: Long-lived sessions could be compromised if device is compromised
3. **Downloaded Content**: Downloaded files could contain malware (scan recommended)
4. **Network Traffic**: API communication visible to network administrators

### Mitigations

1. **Credential Encryption**: API credentials encrypted with OS keystore
2. **Session Management**: Sessions can be revoked remotely through Telegram
3. **File Scanning**: Users advised to scan downloaded files
4. **VPN Support**: Application works with VPNs for network privacy
